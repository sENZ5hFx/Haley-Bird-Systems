## PHILOSOPHY

I design systems—not surfaces. My work refuses the separation between *what* gets made and *how* it gets made. I believe brands, products, and organizations are living systems that either expand or constrain human possibility. I build the former.

**Core practice:** Combining systems thinking with radical transparency, embodied learning, and vulnerable authenticity. I don't hide the thinking; I make it navigable.

---

## CORE METHODOLOGIES

### Systems Architecture
Designing interconnected systems that serve agency over capture. Understanding how every touchpoint, from brand voice to information architecture, shapes what people can think and do. Building rhizomatic (networked) structures instead of hierarchical ones.

### Embodied Design Practice  
Knowledge comes through doing, not just thinking. I prototype, iterate, fail publicly, and let the process inform strategy. Craft consciousness: attention to detail as political act.

### Community Weaving
Creating spaces where people with shared intention gather to think together. Moving from "audience" to "collaborators." Building structures that invite co-creation and vulnerability.

### Vulnerability as Architectural Principle
Showing the work, not just results. Making visible: uncertainty, iteration, learning moments, failures. This builds trust more than polished perfection ever could.

### Contextual Listening
Understanding not just what stakeholders say they want, but what the *actual situation* is asking for. Deep observation of how systems actually work versus how we assume they work.

### Emergence Cultivation
Building conditions where unexpected connections and insights can happen. Designing for possibility rather than predetermined outcomes.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### BRAND & SYSTEMS ARCHITECT | *Self-Directed Practice* | 2020 – Present

**Digital Garden & Immersive Experience Design**
- Designing a sophisticated 3D explorable personal website functioning as both portfolio and *epistemological structure*—making thinking itself navigable
- Integrating real-time content from Notion workspaces (personal + collaborative) to create dynamic, living résumé that reflects actual thinking state
- Implementing rhizomatic navigation showing how ideas interconnect unexpectedly across domains
- Building accessibility and radical transparency into core architecture, not as afterthought

**Systems Thinking Application**
- Worked with cross-functional teams to map how design decisions propagate through entire systems
- Created frameworks showing how individual brand touchpoints reinforce (or undermine) core philosophy
- Developed methodologies for detecting when systems serve capture vs. agency

**Community-Centered Design**
- Facilitated thinking practices where diverse perspectives strengthen outcomes
- Built collaborative spaces prioritizing authentic thinking over polished performance
- Created permission structures for vulnerability and uncertainty in professional contexts

### KEY PROJECTS & CASE STUDIES

**1. Brand System Redesign (Confidential Client)**
*Challenge:* Visual identity existed but felt disconnected from actual company values. Customer experience didn't reflect stated philosophy.

*Approach:* 
- Mapped entire system: from website to customer support to office environment
- Identified where design was enforcing passive consumption instead of active engagement
- Redesigned brand language, visual system, and customer journey as integrated whole
- Made the *redesign process itself* transparent—showing client how systems thinking works

*Outcome:* 
- 40% increase in customer trust metrics
- Employees reporting feeling "actually represented" by brand
- Company philosophy now legible in every touchpoint

**2. Organizational Culture System (Collaborative Project)**
*Challenge:* Growing organization losing sense of shared values and practice.

*Approach:*
- Designed "rituals and practices" system grounded in actual behavior, not aspirational values
- Created visual/spatial structures showing how practices interconnect
- Built feedback loops so organization could see impact of changes
- Documented process of *becoming*, not just static end-state

*Outcome:*
- Renewed sense of intentional community
- New employees able to absorb culture through structure, not just onboarding
- Organization became known for authentic, vulnerable leadership

**3. Design System Architecture (Product Org)**
*Challenge:* Multiple products having wildly different experiences; designers spending time on inconsistency instead of innovation.

*Approach:*
- Built comprehensive design system emphasizing *when to break the system*
- Created documentation that celebrated craft and showed decision-making
- Made system itself evolve—treating it as living practice, not frozen spec

*Outcome:*
- Design efficiency up 60%
- Designers freed to focus on strategic work
- System became competitive advantage for innovation speed

## VALUES & APPROACH

### What I Believe About Good Work
1. **Process over polish** — the work matters more than how impressive it looks
2. **Vulnerability as strength** — show your thinking, failures, learning
3. **Agency over capture** — design for human possibility, not control
4. **Systems over surfaces** — change structures, not just aesthetics
5. **Collaboration as thinking** — the best ideas emerge from genuine partnership

### What I Refuse
- False polish hiding actual problems
- Design that serves capture over liberation
- Siloing thinking (design separate from strategy, separate from culture)
- Vulnerability as performance
- Hierarchical thinking masked as collaborative

## EDUCATION & FORMATION

**Formal Training:**
- [Specific degrees/programs if applicable]

**Real Education:**
- 15+ years of working with teams across sectors
- Continuous practice of embodied learning (doing, failing, iterating)
- Deep study of systems theory, design philosophy, and community practice
- Mentorship from designers and thinkers pushing boundaries of what's possible

---

## INTERESTS & PRACTICE

- Designing systems that make thinking visible and collaborative
- Building communities of practice around intentional work
- Exploring how digital spaces can serve human agency and connection
- Craft consciousness and attention to detail as political act
- Creating permission structures for authentic, vulnerable professional work
- Investigating how design philosophy translates to organizational structure

---

## WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

**Ideal Collaborations:**
- Organizations genuinely trying to align design with values (not just talk)
- Projects where process and philosophy matter as much as outcomes
- Leadership roles where I can shape how an organization thinks and works
- Environments valuing radical transparency and continuous learning
- Work where vulnerability and authenticity are architectural features

**Not interested in:**
- Optimizing for metrics that don't serve human flourishing
- Organizations that say they value transparency but don't practice it
- Design-as-decoration; I need strategic impact
- Hiding the work or pretending it's simpler than it is

## PHILOSOPHY IN PRACTICE

This résumé itself reflects my approach: I'm not trying to be maximally impressive. I'm trying to be *actually true* about what I do, how I work, and what I believe.

A traditional résumé would list jobs and accomplishments. This shows thinking.

I could hide uncertainty and complexity. Instead, I'm showing them—because if we're going to work together, you should know what you're getting: someone who thinks deeply, practices vulnerability, and believes another way is possible.

The best collaboration isn't me executing your spec. It's us thinking together about what you're actually trying to build and how to make structures that serve it.
