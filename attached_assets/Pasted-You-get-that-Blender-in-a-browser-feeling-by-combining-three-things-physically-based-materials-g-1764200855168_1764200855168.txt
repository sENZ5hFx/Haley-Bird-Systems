You get that “Blender-in-a-browser” feeling by combining three things: physically based materials, good lighting/depth, and a strict design system for when to go photoreal vs. stylized.[1][2]

## 3D depth that actually feels spatial

- Use **camera + composition + depth effects**: a slightly offset perspective camera, foreground/midground/background objects, fog, and optional depth-of-field give instant depth cues, especially when tied to your `activeSection`.[3][4][5]
- Add **shadows and contact**: turn on shadows for key meshes and use a shadow-receiving ground or contact plane; tutorials show that even simple soft shadows immediately push Three.js/R3F scenes out of “flat demo” territory.[6][7][8]
- Consider **subtle postprocessing**: depth-of-field and fog via `@react-three/postprocessing` can make your rooms feel like lenses looking into a world instead of a flat canvas, as long as you keep effects gentle to avoid performance hits.[4][5][3]

## Textures, materials, and “lived-in” surfaces

- Use **PBR materials** (`meshStandardMaterial` with maps) for anything that should feel physical—color (albedo), normal, roughness, AO, and optionally displacement maps; R3F texture-loading docs show how to wire all of these via `useTexture`.[9][10][11]
- For “lifelike” realism: pick or bake high-quality textures, pair color + normal + roughness correctly, and use linear color spaces for normal maps when needed to avoid artifacts.[12][13][9]
- For “cyberpunk / cyberspace”: lean into emissive colors, fresnel-style rim light, and stylized shaders; shader guides with R3F show how to create atmospheric edge glows and custom materials that still sit on top of proper depth and lighting.[14][15]

## Design system: when to go big, when to stay light

- Define **where 3D earns its keep**: pick a few hero interactions or rooms where you go deep with geometry, textures, and lighting; elsewhere, use lighter, abstract geometry or particles so the site doesn’t feel visually or computationally noisy.[16][1]
- Set **material tiers**:  
  - Tier 1: fully PBR, shadows, maybe postprocessing (hero scenes, key “installations”).  
  - Tier 2: lit but simpler materials (MeshStandard or MeshLambert, limited textures) for supporting elements.  
  - Tier 3: unlit/emissive for UI-linked accents where performance and clarity matter most.[17][16]
- Keep a **global mood Bible**: a palette of environments (e.g., “Garden dusk,” “Neon atrium,” “Soft studio”) that define light, fog, contrast, and motion per room so each space feels intentional rather than random.[8][9][16]

## “Perfectly accessorized” without killing performance

- Reuse **texture sets and material definitions** across rooms instead of creating everything from scratch; R3F examples show how far you can go with a small library of well-chosen assets.[11][1]
- Use **instancing and simple geo** for repeated elements (orbs, particles, tiles) so you can fill space and imply richness without paying a per-mesh cost.[5][1][16]
- Profile and tune: drop poly counts where normal maps can fake detail, and reserve the heaviest effects (high-res displacement, complex shaders) for the few places where they deliver emotional impact.[12][16]

If you want to ground this, next step is: pick one room (e.g., “Garden”) and decide whether it should feel like a physical courtyard, a neon data-forest, or something else; then your material, light, and texture choices snap into place around that one clear mood.
